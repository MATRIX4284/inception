/**
 * Support Class representing an Viewport.
 * Multiple viewports are possible and are represented as arrays.
 * Each Viewport contains the @documentText for that part of the document.
 * Each Viewport also shows only specific layers, represented in @layers (contains the layerIds)
 *
 * Attributes:
 * @documentText: String representation of the document text for a certain viewport starting with @begin up to @end
 * @begin: The character offset begin of the viewport
 * @end: The character offset end of the viewport
 * @layers: List of layers the viewport shows. The list contains the layerIds
