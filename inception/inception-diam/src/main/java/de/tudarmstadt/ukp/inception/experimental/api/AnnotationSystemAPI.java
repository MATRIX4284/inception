/**
 * Interface-class for the System API
 *
 * The System API handles all back-end computations and listens to all Events regarding the
 * annotation workflow (events in 'inception-api-annotation/src/main/java/../../event/*')
 *
 * There are two different types of methods in this class: handle() methods: All handle() methods
 * retrieve a class object as argument that has been generated from the clients message JSON string
 * payload in the ProcessAPI. All handle() methods simply use the retrieved data to perform the
 * requested operation, like deleting a span-annotation or updating a feature value of an
 * annotation. NOTE: All handle() methods contain a try-catch block to handle errors. Whenever an
 * error occurs, informative data is send back to the client that has sent the request. This is done
 * in the catch-block via 'createAdviceMessage()'. onEventHandler() methods: As already explained,
 * these methods listen to specific events created on the server. This 'listening' is performed via
 * an '@EventListener' annotation before the method definition retrieving the corresponding event as
 * method-parameter. The onEventHandler() message always retrieve the data from the Event and create
 * a suitable class-object as response. Finally, they always invoke the suitable method in the
 * 
 * @see AnnotationProcessAPI to forward the data from the event to the clients. NOTE: Events can be
 *      triggered in the back-end at any time.
 *
 *      NOTE: The System API also contains many private support methods. These can only be found in
 *      the
 * @see AnnotationSystemAPI implementation. All support methods are commented in detail.
 *
 *      NOTE: For further information please look into the README file
